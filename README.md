# Relationship between crime and characteristics of urban parks in Medellín, Colombia
## Juliana Restrepo Tobar

### Abstract:
Environmental criminology theories analyze the relationship between crime rates and features
of bounded geographic areas, such as neighborhoods, census tracts, cities, counties, states,
or nations. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) theory represents a
multifaceted approach to crime reduction that outlines six principles: Surveillance, defensible
space, access control, territorial reinforcement, target hardening, space management, and activity
support. Although there are studies on the relationship between crime and urban characteristics
in areas of Medell´ın, Colombia, none use parks as their spatial unit of analyisis. We ran four
models to analyze the relationship between crimes (thefts to people and homicides) in urban parks
and their socioeconomic, surveillance and urban design characteristics. We found that covariates
that relate to the floating population in the parks are significant and correlate positively to their
crime rates. Density of trees does not appear to have correlation with crimes in parks, and
unexpectedly, the density of cameras and light poles in the park correlates positively to the
robberies within it. Finally, the number of sports facilities (i.e. courts, fields, stadiums, etc.)
within and around a park seems to have a negative correlation to its robberies.
